## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac Main.java`).
3. Run the compiled code (e.g., `java Main`).

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to choose an operation (1 - 3).
2. Type the desired operation number and press enter.
    - If you choose `1`, it will execute the task from lab1.
    - If you choose `2`, it will execute the task from lab3.
    - If you choose `3`, the program will stop.
    - If you enter any other number, it will prompt you to enter a correct number.

## Code Structure

The `Main` class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program. It handles user input and calls the respective Lab functions based on the user's choice.

- The `Lab1` and `Lab3` packages contain the respective classes and methods for Lab1 and Lab3 operations.
- The program uses a `Scanner` to read user input.

## Note

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine to compile and run the code.
